                            Being an Audiophile and a food lover, I decided to make something that incorporates both of
                            them. I built a web application that allows users to generate beautiful restaurant menus and
                            other posters based on their Spotify preferences and activities. Currently, the web
                            application has over 300 users and 500 visits.

                            While serving my National Service, I realised that many repetitive and manual tasks can be
                            automated. As a programmer, I saw this as an opportunity to practise my programming skills
                            and make my daily tasks easier. Being on an Intranet, Excel VBA was as close as I could get
                            to doing any sort of programming without additional installations. During my first month at
                            my unit, I digitalized multiple physical logbooks. This allowed users to autofill their
                            details and sign digitally. I have also written 3 other scripts that prepare data for audit,
                            prepare data and create dashboards from data generated from SQL and help tech support users
                            to manage their tickets and send emails automatically. This is currently being used
                            internally by MINDEF, Accenture, NCS and Maventree employees daily. Due to the nature of the
                            workplace, the files are all restricted for external use.

                            During my National Service, I was determined to make the most use of my two years. I decided
                            to take Harvard’s CS50 course. With 2022 being a hard time for the entire world, we needed
                            to treat each other better to prevent any more negativity. For the final project for CS50, I
                            decided to build a chrome extension that uses Tensorflow Models to predict the toxicity and
                            negativity in the text that users type. This can encourage users to rephrase their negative
                            sentences and prevent any unintentional toxicity.

                        <h4>During my Final Year at Temasek Polytechnic, for my Major Project, I worked with TIBCO and
                            Schroders to create a dashboard with TIBCO’s software for Schroders to detect anomalies in
                            their trades and report any potentially suspicious activities. TIBCO’s software allows users
                            to write their own custom data preparation and visualisation functions using PYTHON, R, JS
                            and HTML. This dashboard reduced the time required for the workflow from about 14 days to
                            about 2 days. This project was awarded “TIBCO Software Singapore Project Prize” for the Top
                            3 Outstanding Major Project Students and it was showcased to the public and media along with
                            4 other top projects for Temasek Polytechnic’s Infotech day. Due to the nature of the data,

                            For my Final Year Internship at Temasek Polytechnic, I interned at GIC as a trainee in the
                            Technology Group under the Risk and Performance Management Department. I worked with senior
                            engineers to refactor the legacy credit limit management system to a whole new system using
                            the AGILE methodology. The front end was created with React and I created an API to get data
                            from the internal database. Creating the front end with an API allows the front end and
                            backend components to be managed separately and allow future scalability. After the
                            internship, I accepted an associate role for another 2 months before my National Service
                            begins.
